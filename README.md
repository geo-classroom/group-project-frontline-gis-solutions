# Frontline GIS Solutions

#### Project description/about:
For this project, our team is the consultant for the Department of Health in South Africa, with a primary goal of evaluating the current positions for the medical facilities in Mamelodi. In order to evaluate these facilities and their positions, we needed to model the catchment areas for each medical facility. This will take into account the transport network which would have an effect on the magnitude of the catchment area. Thereafter, each catchment area will be evaluated according to the demographics of that area using the available census data. This will give an indication of how well positioned the medical facility is. Finally, the medical facilities in the Mamelodi area will be ranked according to their positioning and the size of their catchment area. This will support decision making with regard to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations. Facilities which service larger areas and a greater magnitude of the population should be prioritized when resources are distributed, as this will ensure that medical facilities are supported in a way that is proportional to the support they provide to their individual catchment areas.
